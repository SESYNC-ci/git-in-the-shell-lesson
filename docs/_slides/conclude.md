## Share and Share Back

- The repository you created is an example of the heart of a
  distributed workflow. Putting the **origin** of your project on
  GitHub (or similar) will make it accessible not only by your
  collaborators, but also available for review and extension by your
  research community.
  
- GitHub is the home of the vast majority of open source sofware,
  including R and Pythong packages, that help research
  advance. Through GitHub you can track issues with software you use,
  pitch in on solving problems, and even submit "pull requests" for
  new features you develop.
