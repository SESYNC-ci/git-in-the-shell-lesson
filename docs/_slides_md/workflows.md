## Reproducible Research: the finished product

The result of reproducible research is more than a published paper, it includes the whole data-to-document **pipeline**. In a typical socio-environmental synthesis project, a finished pipeline will include [some of] the following steps:

1. [Aquire raw data from online repository.]
1. Extract, transform, and load data into suitable format for analysis.
1. Perform data analyses (e.g. parameter inference).
1. Store visual, tabular, or raw summaries of results.
1. [Update documentation and publish results.]

[Carl Boettiger](http://www.carlboettiger.info), a professor at UC Berkeley, is
a strong advocate for open science who publishes clear & reproducible pipelines.
For example, work leading up to the paper ["Pretty Darn Good Control"](http://github.com/cboettig/pdg_control) is on [GitHub](http://github.com),
a website integrated with the `git` version control system.

Integrating `git` with cloud services like GitHub creates a complete system for project management, collaboration, and sharing.

## Constructing the pipeline

A **workflow** describes how your team collaboratively assemble the code, software environment, and integrations that comprise the **pipeline**. Collaborative workflows require communication&mdash;version control systems facilitate it.
