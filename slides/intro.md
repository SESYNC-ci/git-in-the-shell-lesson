This lesson explains a high level strategy for organizing your collaborative
workflow and introduces accompanying software and cloud solutions. This strategy

are *spokes* on the wheel, working on private copies of the
project. Project integrity is maintained through rules enforced by the
hub for *synchronizing* between hub and spokes.
